[Embed and customize maps](https://smultron.software/blog/embed-and-customize-google-maps)

> The easiest way (but also the one that gives you the least amount of control) is to embed the map view via an iframe directly from Google Maps.

> So if you need to embed a map with multiple markers, information on the coverage of a selected service, or enrich it with interactions or data that are not publicly available, it is worth turning to a specialist with such a task.

> For sites with higher traffic, you will have to pay for each additional 1,000 requests. Fees vary, depending on the API used and the total number of requests. As an example, the cost of Maps Javascript API, after exceeding 28,500 requests, is $7 for each additional 1,000 requests (above 100,000 requests, the cost per 1,000 requests decreases)


### Prompts and questions

> Hi! I would like to trace a route on Google Maps dynamically, do I need to use JavaScript or what other methods could I use? Please, make an example with the next city: Bucaramanga, Santander, Colombia.

> There's a way to constrain the searchable spaces, like if I want sers to only have available the city of Bucaramanga.
